One of the great features of Kotlin [data classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html) is their [`copy` method](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html#copying). But using it can become cumbersome very quickly, because you need to repeat the name of the field before and after.

```kotlin
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

val p1 = Person("Alex", 1)
val p2 = p1.copy(age = p1.age + 1)  // too many 'age'!
```

This plug-in generates a couple of new methods that make working with immutable data classes much easier.

## Mutable `copy`

This new version of `copy` takes a *block* as parameter. Within that block mutability is simulated; the final assignment of each (mutable) variable becomes the value of the new copy.

```kotlin
val p1 = Person("Alex", 1)
val p2 = p1.transform { 
  age++
}
```

You can use `old` to access the previous (immutable) value, before any changes.

```kotlin
val p3 = p1.transform { 
  age++
  if (notTheirBirthday) {
    age = old.age  // get the previous value
  }
}
```

## Mapping `copyMap`

Instead of new *values*, `copyMap` takes as arguments the *transformations* that ought to be applied to each argument.

```kotlin
val p1 = Person("Alex", 1)
val p2 = p1.copyMap(age = { it + 1 })
```

Note that you can use `copyMap` to simulate `copy`, by making the transformation return a constant value.

```kotlin
val p3 = p1.transform(age = { 10 })
```

### List transformations

If a field has type `List<T>`, then an additional argument is added to the `copyMap` function with the name `${field}Each`. The block given to that argument is applied to each element of the list. This is like an implicit `map`.

```kotlin
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int, val nicknames: List<String>)

val p1 = Person("Alex", 1, listOf("Serras"))
val p2 = p1.copyMap(nicknamesEach = { it.lowercase() })
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that if you provide both `fieldEach` and `field` transformations, the one for the elements is applied first, and the one for the entire field is applied afterwards.

## Value class `copy`

[Value-based classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/inline-classes.html) are useful to create wrapper that separate different concepts, but without any overhead. A good example is wrapping an integer as an age:

```kotlin
value class Age(val age: Int)
```

The plug-in generates a `copy` method which takes the transformation to apply to the _single_ field as parameter.

```kotlin
val a1 = Age(1)
val a2 = a1.copy { it + 1 }
```

## Customizing the generation

You can disable the generation of some of these methods by [passing options to KSP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html#pass-options-to-processors) in your Gradle file. For example, the following block disables the generation of `copyMap`.

```kotlin
ksp {
  arg("mutableCopy", "true")
  arg("copyMap", "false")
  arg("valueCopy", "true")
}
```

By default, the three kinds of methods are generated.

## What about optics?

Optics, like the ones provided by [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/optics/), are a much more powerful abstraction. Apart from changing fields, optics allow uniform access to collections, possubly-null values, and hierarchies of data classes. You can even define a [single `copy` function](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow/pull/2777) which works for _every_ type, instead of relying on generating an implementation for each data type.

KopyKat, on the other hand, aims to be just a tiny step further from Kotlin's built-in `copy`. By re-using well-known idioms, the barrier to introducing this plug-in becomes much lower. Our goal is to make it easier to work with immutable data classes.
